# New_Pong_SDL3

New_Pong_SDL3 is a remake of the New_Pong, but in SDL3 and with another feature.
The install is really simple:
  - First, clone the git repository using:
`git clone https://github.com/pROmeTEuL/New_Pong_SDL3.git`
  - Then, create a build folder and run cmake from that folder onto the project folder
``mkdir ../build
cd ../build
cmake ../New_Pong``
  - After that run the executable file and enjoy the game
Features added to the game (WIP):
  - Multiplayer (just like squash game, but it's pong)
  - A menu to choose between multiplayer and singleplayer, made using ImGui(not yet included)
  - An option to play this game online using a pear-to-pear connection(the final step @_@)
